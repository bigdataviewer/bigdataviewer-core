package bdv.ui.rangeslider;

import javax.swing.JSlider;

/**
 * An extension of JSlider to select a range of values using two thumb controls.
 * The thumb controls are used to select the lower and upper value of a range
 * with predetermined minimum and maximum values.
 * <p>
 * Note that RangeSlider makes use of the default BoundedRangeModel, which
 * supports an inner range defined by a value and an extent. The upper value
 * returned by RangeSlider is simply the lower value plus the extent.
 * <p>
 * This is copied from https://github.com/ernieyu/Swing-range-slider with the
 * following changes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The slider thumbs push each other. That is, the upper thumb can be
 * dragged below the lower thumb, and it will drag the lower thumb with it, and
 * vice versa</li>
 * <li>The {@link #setRange(int, int)} method was added, which sets both the
 * lower and upper values simultaneously.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
