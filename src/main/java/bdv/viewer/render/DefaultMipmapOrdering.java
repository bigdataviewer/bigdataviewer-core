/**
 * The standard mipmap ordering strategy for local hdf5 data. Assumes that
 * mipmap indices in the source are ordered by decreasing resolution. Finds the
 * mipmap level that best matches the given screen scale for the given source.
 * Then, starting from this best level render all levels down to the lowest
 * resolution. For prefetching reverse that order (lowest resolution is
 * prefetched first).
 *
 * Additionally, when moving between time-points the following hack is used:
 * When scrolling through time, we often get frames for which no data was loaded
 * yet. To speed up rendering in these cases, use only two mipmap levels: the
 * optimal and the coarsest. By doing this, we require at most two passes over
 * the image at the expense of ignoring data present in intermediate mipmap
 * levels. The assumption is, that we will either be moving back and forth
 * between images that have all data present already or that we move to a new
 * image with no data present at all.
