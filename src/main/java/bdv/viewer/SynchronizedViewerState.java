/**
 * Maintains the BigDataViewer state and implements {@link ViewerState} to
 * expose query and modification methods. {@code ViewerStateChangeListener}s can
 * be registered and will be notified about various {@link ViewerStateChange
 * state changes}.
 * <p>
 * All methods of this class are {@code synchronized}, so that every individual
 * change to the viewer state is atomic. {@code IllegalArgumentException}s
 * thrown by the wrapped {@code BasicViewerState} are silently swallowed, under
 * the assumption that they result from concurrent changes (for example another
 * thread might have removed the source that you are trying to make current).
 * <p>
 * To perform sequences of operations atomically explicit synchronization is
 * required. In particular, this is true when using the collections returned by
 * {@link #getSources()}, {@link #getActiveSources()}, {@link #getGroups()},
 * {@link #getActiveGroups()}, and {@link #getSourcesInGroup(SourceGroup)}.
 * These collections are backed by the ViewerState, they reflect changes, and
 * they are <em>not thread-safe</em>. It is possible to run into
 * {@code ConcurrentModificationException} when iterating them, etc.
 * <p>
 * Example where explicit synchronization is required:
 * <pre>{@code
 * List<SourceGroup> groupsContainingCurrentSource;
 * synchronized (state) {
 *     SourceAndConverter<?> currentSource = state.getCurrentSource();
 *     groupsContainingCurrentSource =
 *         state.getGroups().stream()
 *             .filter(g -> state.getSourcesInGroup(g).contains(currentSource))
 *             .collect(Collectors.toList());
 * }}</pre>
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, for read-only access, it is possible to (atomically) take an
 * unmodifiable {@link #snapshot()} of the current state.
